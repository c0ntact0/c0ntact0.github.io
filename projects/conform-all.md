ConformAll is a Python script developed to the Blackmagic DaVinci Resolve making use of the DaVinci Resolve Scripting API. The purpose of this script is to facilitate the relink between the proxy <span translate="no"> media </span> used in editing and the high-resolution material that is used in <span translate="no"> grading </span>. The high resolution media can be ingested to a nearline storage (high density, more space and lower cost), a proxy can be generated from the nearline to the editing storage (less density, less space and more costly) to edition with a NLE (e.g. Avid Media Composer). After edition a AAF file can be exported from the NLE and imported with the ConformAll script to the DaVinci Resolve for <span translate="no"> grading </span> (or other operations).  

To learn about the advantages of using this script, please read the ConformAll manual available in the GitHub repository.
