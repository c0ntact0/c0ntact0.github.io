<h1>About me!</h1>

Hi everyone.

I'm a computer science engineer that loves everything related with technology and science. I started working with computers in 1994, programming in Pascal, Turbo Pascal and Clipper. At the time, I work with some vintage processor, like the Intel 80286 (aka Intel 286) and the Intel 80386 (aka Intel 386). In my work life, I mainly worked as system administrator and network administrator. My core knowledge is in video and audio post-production facilities as IT manager. I have skills in managing fabric SAN infrastructures like Xsan, scale-out storages as Avid Nexis and LTO backup libraries (by Quantum) using the Bacula open source software.<br><br> 

As software developer, I have created a GUI to manage and edit metadata of the open source <a href="https://ingex.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">Ingex</a>  software created by the BBC R&D Labs. If you want to know more about my recent projects, take a look at the Projects page.
